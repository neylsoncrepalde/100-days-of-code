# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Joined the team!

**Thoughts:** I think it's going to be an awesome advance for me. I believe practice will get me a better researcher/analyst.

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I started to code the Network Diffusion Model that I am problably going to use in my PhD dissertation.

**Thoughts:** Although it was really hard beacuse I have to work with a new python library (nxsim), it was also great. I felt like I did some progress and this is a very precious feeling in my opinion. I have to study *nxsim* and also *simpy* a lot more.

**Link to work:** http://github.com/neylsoncrepalde/diffusion_models. The code I'm talking about is difusao_qualidade.py.

### Day 2, January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I started to learn how to write pseudo-codes in LaTex.

**Thoughts:** Reeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaally difficult. But with some work, maybe I'll get used to it.

### Day 3, January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Working in network diffusion model in Python. Today, I achieved to separate the simulations in two halfs and stated different parameters for each half. Comparisons and interesting stuff begin to appear. I also started a new .py doc to do the social network analysis. I stated also every other probability to 50% to try to isolate the *Critics_rating* effect. Now, I think I must play a little with the parameters. Maybe tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Awesome! Very exciting. This is something I've been thinking of for days and it's finally working. Yeaaaah!!!

**Link to work:** http://github.com/neylsoncrepalde/diffusion_models. The code I'm talking about is difusao_qualidade.py. The SNA are in difusao_qualidade_analises.py.

### Day 4, January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** After some time off because of a simple surgery, I'm finally back. Today I studied some Django. I have started to study this framework before but today I found out that I have forgotten almost everythin. It was nice to remember somethings, though. I got until the admin page of a static blog. Tomorrow, I'll try to finish it. It's supposed to be fast, right (at least after you know it...).

**Thoughts:** Really nice work. I'm pretty sure that Django can be very useful although I'm not a developer (I'm a sociologist). It seems like a nice way to prepare a blog or to show some research results or build a portfolio... It seems more WEB than R's shiny which I'm a little bit more acquainted.

**Link to work:** Not deployed yet.

### Day 5, January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked on the text analysis and statistical analysis for a paper on politics with my friend Maria Alice Silveira. I managed to finish the statistical analysis of Facebook data and did the expolatory part on Twitter data. Sentiment analysis is on the way. I also did some serious research on translation methods in python.

**Thoughts:** Productive, productive, productive.

### Day 6, January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on sentiment analysis on twitter data using Lexicons and machine learning algorithms in R.

**Thoughts:** Reaaaaaly difficult. I've studied machine learning techniques but never applied them actually. Lot of effort but great results. Random Forest algorithm was the best, followed by Support Vector Machines.

**Link to work:** blog post on the procedures coming soon.

### Day 7, January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I wrote a small blog in Django. I'll try to expand it to a full website!

**Thoughts:** Difficult at first. Awesome at last.

**Link to work:** Not deployed yet. I'll put it on github as soon it is a little more robust.

### Day 8, January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the GIARS Shiny App.

**Thoughts:** I think it is great. I sure learned a lot doing it.

**Link to work:** https://giars.shinyapps.io/shiny-redes

### Day 9, January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on a Jupyter Notebook tutorial on how to fit a linear regression in Python.

**Thoughts:** I had to do some research on *statsmodels* library. Great learning.

**Link to work:** I'm posting it soon.

### Day 10, January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked on a website using Django and Wagtail.

**Thoughts:** The pages are almost finished. Great learning. Wagtail can be a little tricky, although I think it's easier than pure Django.

**Link to work:** Not deployed yet.

### Day 11 and 12, January, 24 & 25, 2017.

**Today's Progress:** I have been developing the website that I just told you about.

**Thoughts:** It's almost ready. As I am beginning to work with Wagtail, I had a lot of erros that took me some time to correct.

**Link to work:** Not deployed yet.

### Day 13, January, 28, 2017.

**Today's Progress:** I finished Getsemani Choir's website. It was developed with Django and Wagtail. I uploaded it on github and I have already paid for the domain. Next week, I intend to deploy it.

**Thoughts:** Mission acomplished!

### Day 14, February, 1st, 2017.

**Today's Progress:** Worked on some text analysis of facebook data trying to get main topics and public opinion. Sentiment analysis tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Great. I just found out that read_tsv() function from readr package got errors to read the data. The sane happened to the base function read.delim or read.table. fread() function from data.table did the job.

### Day 15, February, 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked with huge Brazilian Census dataset in R. This was done using a beautiful package by lucasmation.

**Thoughts:** Working with big data can be tough!

### Day 16, February, 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on Face Recognition with Python and OpenCV.

**Thoughts:** Awesome. It took me a couple of hours to figure out that installing Python2 instead of trying to work inside Python3 was the best ideia (and the one that saved me some time).

**Link to work:** Not uploaded yet.

### Day 17, February, 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on some data visualization with matplotlib (Python).

**Thoughts:** Trying to master several dataviz types.

**Link to work:** It'll become a blog post soon.

### Day 18, February, 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Deployed the wagtail/django website!

**Thoughts:** Happy!!! It still needs a lot of work on mobile viz. Any help?

### Day 19, February, 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on some map plotting with R. Tried Leaflet, map+maptools and ggmap.

** Thoughts:** I almost got an interactive map with leaflet. Maybe tomorrow.

**Link to work:** not deployed.

### Day 20, February, 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did some descriptive analysis of several datasets with tidyr, dplyr and datatable in R.

**Thoughts:** Doing descriptive analysis of data appears to be simple but when you have to do it "fast and furious", with hard deadlines, it makes you learn a lot about data handling, which is awesome.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/neylsoncrepalde/RASTREIA

### Day 21, February, 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on a Face Recognition blog post.

**Thoughts:** It's an awesome strategy to write posts on the topics you're studying. It makes you fix the topic.

### Day 22, February, 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on content analysis and sentiment analysis of Facebook and Twitter data.

**Thoughts:** The datasets I'm using are considerably big. I would say this is big data. Lots of work regarding the time spent to run the algorithms and memory management.

**Link to work:** Still a draft paper.

### Days 23-24, February, 26-27, 2017

**Two day's Progress:** Worked on Setiment Analysis of Facebook and Twitter data for an article. 

**Thoughts:** Viewing the wordclouds of the most retweeted people was really good. Clarified some things. The sentiment analysis worked very well for the facebook data, not so well for twitter data.

### Days 28, 29, March, 8,9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I've worked with some encoding problems in R. Me and Marcus, my excellent intern, discovered the amazing *enc2native()* function in R. It solved our problems.

**Thoughts:** Awesome. Two days working on it untill we found a solution.

**Link to work:** Blog Post coming soon!

### Day 30, March, 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I've worked on some calculus on Python.
