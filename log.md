**Today's Progress**: Joined the team!

**Thoughts:** I think it's going to be an awesome advance for me. I believe practice will get me a better researcher/analyst.

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I started to code the Network Diffusion Model that I am problably going to use in my PhD dissertation.

**Thoughts:** Although it was really hard beacuse I have to work with a new python library (nxsim), it was also great. I felt like I did some progress and this is a very precious feeling in my opinion. I have to study *nxsim* and also *simpy* a lot more.

### Day 2, January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I started to learn how to write pseudo-codes in LaTex.

**Thoughts:** Reeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaally difficult. But with some work, maybe I'll get used to it.
