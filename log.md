# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Joined the team!

**Thoughts:** I think it's going to be an awesome advance for me. I believe practice will get me a better researcher/analyst.

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I started to code the Network Diffusion Model that I am problably going to use in my PhD dissertation.

**Thoughts:** Although it was really hard beacuse I have to work with a new python library (nxsim), it was also great. I felt like I did some progress and this is a very precious feeling in my opinion. I have to study *nxsim* and also *simpy* a lot more.

### Day 2, January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I started to learn how to write pseudo-codes in LaTex.

**Thoughts:** Reeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaally difficult. But with some work, maybe I'll get used to it.

### Day 3, January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Working in network diffusion model in Python. Today, I achieved to separate the simulations in two halfs and stated different parameters for each half. Comparisons and interesting stuff begin to appear. I also started a new .py doc to do the social network analysis. I stated also every other probability to 50% to try to isolate the *Critics_rating* effect. Now, I think I must play a little with the parameters. Maybe tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Awesome! Very exciting. This is something I've been thinking of for days and it's finally working. Yeaaaah!!!

### Day 4, January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** After some time off because of a simple surgery, I'm finally back. Today I studied some Django. I have started to study this framework before but today I found out that I have forgotten almost everythin. It was nice to remember somethings, though. I got until the admin page of a static blog. Tomorrow, I'll try to finish it. It's supposed to be fast, right (at least after you know it...).

**Thoughts:** Really nice work. I'm pretty sure that Django can be very useful although I'm not a developer (I'm a sociologist). It seems like a nice way to prepare a blog or to show some research results or build a portfolio... It seems more WEB than R's shiny which I'm a little bit more acquainted.

**Link to work:** Not deployed yet.
