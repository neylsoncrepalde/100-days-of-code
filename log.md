# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Joined the team!

**Thoughts:** I think it's going to be an awesome advance for me. I believe practice will get me a better researcher/analyst.

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I started to code the Network Diffusion Model that I am problably going to use in my PhD dissertation.

**Thoughts:** Although it was really hard beacuse I have to work with a new python library (nxsim), it was also great. I felt like I did some progress and this is a very precious feeling in my opinion. I have to study *nxsim* and also *simpy* a lot more.

**Link to work:** http://github.com/neylsoncrepalde/diffusion_models. The code I'm talking about is difusao_qualidade.py.

### Day 2, January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I started to learn how to write pseudo-codes in LaTex.

**Thoughts:** Reeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaally difficult. But with some work, maybe I'll get used to it.

### Day 3, January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Working in network diffusion model in Python. Today, I achieved to separate the simulations in two halfs and stated different parameters for each half. Comparisons and interesting stuff begin to appear. I also started a new .py doc to do the social network analysis. I stated also every other probability to 50% to try to isolate the *Critics_rating* effect. Now, I think I must play a little with the parameters. Maybe tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Awesome! Very exciting. This is something I've been thinking of for days and it's finally working. Yeaaaah!!!

**Link to work:** http://github.com/neylsoncrepalde/diffusion_models. The code I'm talking about is difusao_qualidade.py. The SNA are in difusao_qualidade_analises.py.

### Day 4, January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** After some time off because of a simple surgery, I'm finally back. Today I studied some Django. I have started to study this framework before but today I found out that I have forgotten almost everythin. It was nice to remember somethings, though. I got until the admin page of a static blog. Tomorrow, I'll try to finish it. It's supposed to be fast, right (at least after you know it...).

**Thoughts:** Really nice work. I'm pretty sure that Django can be very useful although I'm not a developer (I'm a sociologist). It seems like a nice way to prepare a blog or to show some research results or build a portfolio... It seems more WEB than R's shiny which I'm a little bit more acquainted.

**Link to work:** Not deployed yet.

### Day 5, January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I worked on the text analysis and statistical analysis for a paper on politics with my friend Maria Alice Silveira. I managed to finish the statistical analysis of Facebook data and did the expolatory part on Twitter data. Sentiment analysis is on the way. I also did some serious research on translation methods in python.

**Thoughts:** Productive, productive, productive.

### Day 6, January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on sentiment analysis on twitter data using Lexicons and machine learning algorithms in R.

**Thoughts:** Reaaaaaly difficult. I've studied machine learning techniques but never applied them actually. Lot of effort but great results. Random Forest algorithm was the best, followed by Support Vector Machines.

**Link to work:** blog post on the procedures coming soon.

### Day 7, January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I wrote a small blog in Django. I'll try to expand it to a full website!

**Thoughts:** Difficult at first. Awesome at last.

**Link to work:** Not deployed yet. I'll put it on github as soon it is a little more robust.

### Day 8, January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the GIARS Shiny App.

**Thoughts:** I think it is great. I sure learned a lot doing it.

### Day 9, January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Today I worked on a Jupyter Notebook tutorial on how to fit a linear regression in Python.

**Thoughts:** I had to do some research on *statsmodels* library. Great learning.

**Link to work:** I'm posting it soon.
